# When fighting monsters
<time> Jan 29, 2017 </time>

On my walk home from work through Cremorne, a quote is written in enormous lettering on a brick wall. Melbourne offers a plethora of exciting street graffiti for the art fans but this one particularly took my fancy. There was a sinister nature to the text that struck a chord in me. Of late I have felt the very qualities I have set out to remove from myself, traits such as arrogance, stubbornness, and a closed mind, have returned perhaps stronger than if I had left them. In my everyday battle of bettering myself I fear I have become blinded by the conquest and allowed a set of sanctimonious beliefs to take control.

## “I will never be like that”
In recent years I have fortunately come to uncover small aspects of what I choose to be my reason to live. As I progress down this path the growing and learning brings to memory flashes of what my life was like as a kid and what pushed me onto the journey in the first place. I recount so vividly the people I vowed never to turn into and the events I promised myself I would never let happen when I was older.

I remember once there was a man staying with my family. I asked him one morning what his thoughts were on a movie I had come to like, to which he promptly replied, “All science fiction films are made up. They are rubbish”. For many reasons that I would think are quite obvious, and being a kid who loved Star Wars, I found his response aggravating. It was not the sudden dismissal, nor the fact that he thought he was correct beyond any reason of a doubt (we argued for quite some time afterward), it was his inability to look past his own model of reality, if even for just a moment, and entertain someone else’s view. 

The irony of this is that I now respond in the same way when people disagree with me on topics I feel strongly about (which is realistically far too many). How is it that I now embody all that I pledged not to be? The answer lies in what measures we will go to to prevent it from happening.

## My road to Rome
I have trouble with humility. I admit it. It is not at all that I do not value the quality, rather that I just struggle to let my own ideas of what I feel to be correct go, and it is unacceptable. When someone disagrees with me, my opinions rally together and form an offensive force to be reckoned with, combined with a resolute stubbornness, I tend to push many people away. It worsens as I grow, as I feel that because I have made a better life for myself, everyone else should follow what I think is right. I believe this is one of the grossest qualities I have, and I share it with many.

In light of this however, it is important to realise where this seemingly immutable arrogance stems from. Returning to the child, vowing never to become what disgusted me, a resistance arose. I felt a desire to protect myself and everyone else against all of the negativities experienced from those traits. So strong was this resistance that I became closed off to anyone who did not agree with me, believing that my way was better **for them and for me**. It did not come from a place of hate but one of fear in us all becoming subject to a harsher and crueler reality. It was this resistance that turned me into the exact enemy I was fighting. It was my blind allegiance to the idea of ridding these qualities entirely that allowed them to persist.

## Remember what you are fighting for
A sanctimonious nature worked itself into me where I truly believed my techniques, values, and beliefs were superior to others. The more I improved my own life the stronger the force became, that what I knew was best to protect us all from suffering. 2017 for me is centralised on [improving my communication][1]. To progress in this I aim to raise awareness within myself and anybody else for that matter, who may or may not realise, that it is easy to think your way of life is better. It is not. There are many roads to Rome none of which are more correct than the other. 

If any of us have any hope of transmuting our dreams into reality we must maintain an open mind. Whilst we may *feel* more intelligent, we must cast aside our beliefs to listen, for we are often wrong whether we see this at the time or not. This sounds so simple in theory and is of such common vernacular in society but so few practice it, especially myself, so I feel it bears reiterating. *Connections between minds form greater ideas than we could accomplish alone*, and the one sure way to kill that connection is a stubborn arrogance. If I am to take myself back to the initial reason I set out on the path to a better self and world, I am reminded that I chose that path to alleviate suffering, not create it. I would do well to remember this.

## Lean on those around you
It has taken a patient and forgiving environment to help me realise how close minded I often am, and for this I am grateful to everyone who has persisted. However my point here is not just to thank those who helped point it out, but rather to emphasise the importance the people around you have in bringing these darker shades to light. It is difficult to perceive these characteristics alone and perhaps we ought to all ask those around us how we are truly perceived. You may be surprised.
