# Why things don't work out for you before you even start them
<time> Feb 5, 2017 </time>

The noise was deafening standing in the centre of the group. They were in uproar with all manner of crazy commotions and cries of encouragement, as if I were in the midst of a zoo. They were intense to say the least. I walked slowly up to the board held out in front of me, trying to focus amongst all the raucous. I positioned myself into the stance and lay my hand on the board, feeling it’s roughness. On the front of the wood I’d written all the things I felt were holding me back, “Too skinny”, “Not sure if I’ll find real love”, “Not successful enough”, the list went on. However on the back I’d inscribed everything I’d ever wanted, “I’m a great partner, “I’m well travelled”, “A positive person” and so on. I drew my hand back a few times lining it up… focussing… concentrating… A subtle breeze of doubt blew about as I came back for the final lineup. SMACK! The board didn’t break, but my confidence did.

## Seeds of failure
I’m perfectly capable of braking an inch thick wooden board (I broke it on my second attempt). So why did the first time fail? I’ve witnessed people of all shapes, sizes and gender break the board, most on their first try. It was certainly not a matter of strength or intelligence.

Doubt. This subtle emotion creeps up on us at the worst of times, crippling us from the inside without our awareness. It creates cracks in everything it touches but never truly reveals itself as the culprit. If we allow ourselves to sow the seeds of doubt then we reap the thorny bushes they will surely grow into, and that is our choice to make. 

The feeling is a resourceful opponent and knows you well. Doubt knows exactly what you’re afraid of and how to convince you that what you’re doing will trigger some unwarranted reaction toward your deepest fears. It will stop at no lengths to conjure up ridiculous scenarios to cease your efforts. I find if I explore my doubts for what they really are they most often have absolutely no backing, however they *feel* as if they do. Doubt is the worlds most cunning salesperson with depraved ambitions. Allow it to sell you, and you have bought into its tricks. But it’s not invincible.

## Seeds of belief
I’ve found thoughts and ideas are neutral to our brains. Our unconscious behaves with whatever we feed it with, be that positive or negative. Like a small child, it will eat what the parent feeds it with no knowledge as to whether it’s healthy or not. I try to treat my mind in a similar fashion, feeding it vegetables over sugar and water over Coca Cola. 

The morning after my board break I was running over in my head what caused me to fail. I thought, if doubt is the seed of failure, then belief must be the seed of success. Instead of planting these weeds that would grow into doubt, I would make a conscious effort to plant seeds in where I *believed* in what would happen. To begin with, this process seemed silly. If you’ve ever heard of or seen anybody practicing “positive affirmations” then you’ll know what I mean. However the process of brainwashing yourself to a more desirable mindset is a powerful technique that many use, and I decided to put it to the test.

## Run, Forest! Run!
I would by no means consider myself a runner (or even that fit for the matter). I was told as a kid that looked like I’m imitating a raptor from Jurassic Park which soon stopped all ambitions of being an athlete. This was the perfect place for me to practice this “positive affirmations thing” as I had considerable doubt around running.

On a late Thursday night (I was mortified for anyone I knew to see me), I got down to a track by the river and started to jog. Sure enough, the all to familiar feelings of burnings, cramps and pains rose up, but this time I did something different. I imagined myself as a gardener, in charge of a large pasture. I had two bags of seeds in my hands. One would grow a weed, and the other a tree. Every time I complained or thought about how I’d rather be watching Game Of Thrones I pictured myself planting a weed, and every positive thought I had I planted a tree. Very soon I imagined both of these seeds growing. The weeds spread out, smothering everything in their path, competing with themselves for domination as an ugly bush. The trees however grew straight, strong, and tall leaving room for more trees to grow. I started a mantra, “Doubt is the seed of failure, belief is the seed of success…” 

Again and again I repeated it as I ran until the words fell in sync with my breathing and steps. I was careful not to let the weeds grow up, concealed under the canopy, only to become strangler vines and pull my carefully nurtured trees down. With every tree I planted, I soon started taking out the weeds, until there were none left. I wanted to stop. Badly. Part of my mind was begging me to sit down, just for a minute. That’s when the doubt really kicked in.

“I won’t be able to get to the end” I thought, planting another weed. I repeated my mantra. “I’m too unfit for this”, and again battled it with my mantra. My doubt fought against ferociously me, but I was persistent with the garden I was imagining, with the mantra. It nagged and bugged me all the way to the end. Initially I’d set out to run to the park, and walk the rest back. Instead, I’d fell into such a trance that I’d run around the park and all the way home! Belief and determination are powerful allies.

## A double edged sword
I view doubt now as an internal test, something to be conquered. If I’m able to diminish my doubt, I’m ready for what comes next. Doubt has and will always be there, even for the greatest accomplishers in history. Bertrand Russell was quoted saying: 

> The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts <br>
> – Bertrand Russell

I feel the trick is not removing doubt, rather learning how to temper yourself against it in order to strengthen your willpower. It may be seen as a challenge one must take repeatedly in growth, and the more awareness we keep around our doubts, the greater our achievements and the easier our lives become.

After my experiment, I’ve applied a little faith to everything I once doubted. My relationships, my abilities, and what I stand for are just a small fraction of what’s changed for the better. I give people a chance when I was previously dubious. It gives rise to the voice of others if I allow my initial doubt to subside. I give the benefit of a doubt to myself when I take on new endeavours, as I know how crippling it can be when starting out. There’s a piece of paper by my bedside table to remind me. On it is my mantra, that doubt is the seed of failure, and belief is the seed of success.
