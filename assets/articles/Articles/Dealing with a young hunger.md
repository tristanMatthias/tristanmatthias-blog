# Dealing with a young hunger
<time> Jan 22, 2017 </time>

Pacing back and forth on a Saturday morning in my Melbourne apartment, the withdrawal was kicking in. It had been 2 days since I had ‘learnt’ something, 6 days since my last meetup, and a few months had past after my last project. Logically, I knew this reaction was ridiculous, a product of too many self help books, inspirational podcasts and sensationalised blog articles, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t growing. It often arises in us young minds as if to remark, “You are not doing enough. Look at what everyone else has achieved”, forcing us to question who we are, and where we’re going.

The past few years have been an incredible journey of self discovery, growth, and [finding the right people][1] to surround myself with. I’ve rapidly come to find a pleasure in learning and developing myself outside of work, university or any offical ‘education’. Growing up I held a strong belief that I was unable to aspire to much, as many of us are taught in school. When I eventually shifted my thinking over to seeing the chance of what we could all learn and become the childhood desires that I’d neglected for so many years all seemed to emerge at once each calling out for attention. It’s fascinating to observe how different individuals respond to this mind shift. Personally, it latched on tightly to me and formed a new obsession.

## Hunger
In many cases of myself and my friends, in particular young and ambitious men, I’ve noticed a pattern that is a cause of a much stress, performance anxiety, and a general sense of ineptitude. When we release the shackles that bind us to self belief and genuinely begin to realise that we *can* build the life we’ve always dreamt of, we’re met with a smattering of extra obstacles. Often these new problems appear more debilitating than the previous self doubt, at least it did for me. The shift creates an intense hunger to aspire to greater heights, be more, know more, do more. Added to this, the culture of young personal growth  and entrepreneurship is riddled with examples of exceptional feats from 18 year olds. It lead me to doubt, and question whether or not I was too late to make any real difference. I know the absurdity in this line of thinking, being only in my early 20s and with the rest of my life yet to accomplish and experience, however the feeling remains with me and those who share my position.

> This world is a vast and immensely complex reality, and to the young and ambitiously naive we eventually become fixated on how we can change it.

That morning of pacing is unfortunately a regular occurrence, usually followed by several attempts at starting projects, networking or at worst trying to start a business with no real knowledge of what to do; none of which are completed. I’d suspect this is why I have so many unfinished projects and ideas, something common it seems to other wantrepreneurs. It rises up like a storm, clouding the mind and all judgement, and I’ll propel myself at anything I feel has any promise of ‘success’. Sometimes it can persist for days or weeks on end, sending me into a flurry of rushed decisions in a feeble attempt to ‘catchup’ to those who I deem successful. It goes without saying this is a dangerous pattern, and wastes a lot of valuable time, not to mention sends me down a path of doubt. It becomes more hazardous when I project this outside myself, and onto the rest of the world. 

## One step at a time
The more I explored the possibilities of what could be, the inherent issues of the world slowly became more apparent, and with it a burning desire to fix them. I took on a stress so unnecessary to my life, which in turn created the opposite effect to what I desired. I grew frustrated and weary that my goals were so far from actualisation. It sent me on a negative spiral that if I was not careful would throw me back into the pit of self doubt which took so long to crawl out of. This world is a vast and immensely complex reality, and to the young and ambitiously naive we eventually become fixated on how we can change it. It’s not our job. Yet. 

The fore site and desire to create a better world is a wonderful outlook, and often I need to remind myself to apply this to my own life, on a relatively micro scale, instead of the macro. Other passionate individuals I meet, set out on a quest to cure the worlds ailments are also struggling with the same unnecessary pressure. We need to relax.

## Direct the hunger
I’m reminded of a very pivotal conversation I had with a mentor. I was sitting in his house late one night with a few others my age who shared the young hunger. I was describing my passion for public speaking, and how I’m hellbent on becoming a world renowned speaker. He encouraged my obvious passion  and devotion to a better existence, however explained that applying this energy to the world’s problems was misplaced. The effect of trying to shape the world without any real experience, environment or resources would just cause severe frustration and ultimately demoralise us into abandoning the pursuit. Instead, placing this hunger on creating a better life for ourselves would propel us into a position where we are able to effectively assist. 

This made sense to me, but did not address the stressful feeling that I wasn’t doing enough. His answer to this is something I feel the majority of us forget, and that is that **things take time**. The hunger pushes us so often into a place of urgency where we feel there is no time to waste. The rush and flurry of the hunger can be tamed by reminding ourselves that whist it may feel otherwise, there is no real time limit other than that we place on ourselves. 

## Make it stop!
It’s a constant effort to not compare myself against the amazing accomplishments of our culture, but a crucial one nonetheless. Personally, I remind myself of a few things to numb the feeling of overbearing inadequacy:
- Keeping a **faith** that sticking to the path I’m on will result in the changes I want 
- Realising that things take time, and that the ‘long way’ is often the shortest route
- Not contrasting who I am and what I’m doing to my idols and mentors

Of course there is still a drive to improve. Perhaps this will never cease, however keeping these things in mind makes it bearable. If you’ve found a way that works for you, please share it here, and with those around you, as many are in need or oblivious to the effects to leaving it unchecked. 

Our young hunger can be a gift or a curse, depending on where we direct it. If you know someone like this, remind them that they’re doing a good job despite how they feel. Ask them to see how far they’ve already come. If this person is you, then cut yourself some slack, it will all turn out ok in the end.
