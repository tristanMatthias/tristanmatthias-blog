# This too shall pass
<time> Jan 8, 2017 </time>

“Anicca, anicca, anicca…” The chanting continued over and over until the word was imprinted on the front of my brain. I was sitting in a wooden Buddhist hall in the French countryside attempting once again to sit still for an hour, relax my thoughts, and meditate. “A calm and equanimous mind…” the meditation instructor repeated, “patiently and persistently….” 

I would not call myself a Buddhist by any means. However, I am a firm believer in exploring different schools of philosophy and thought, which is what brought me to this rural French meditation centre in the first place. A few years ago I traipsed about Europe volunteering in these centres on a rather cliché journey to “find myself”. There was an eloquent simplicity to life in these centres; eat, work, meditate, sleep. With little room for anything else, no external distractions, and spending prolonged periods of time in these places one tends to focus inwards after a while. 

> Nothing ever stays truly the same. 

There’s an old adage in our culture, “This too shall pass”. The teachings of Buddhism know this as “anicca” in the ancient language of Pali. There is a  subtlety and wisdom to this short phrase that I feel most overlook. *More often than not, the truth we all seek is simpler than we realise.* How often have you looked back at some problem you were trying to solve, which at the time felt complex and convoluted, that in hind-site the solution was something so simple it almost makes you laugh? For me I feel “anicca” is one of these answers, a solution to many a problem we each encounter day to day.

## Our fluid world
If you pay close attention to the smaller details of what’s happening around you the transient and impermanent nature of reality becomes more apparent. Nothing ever stays truly the same. The cars move, the sun rises and sets, the market booms and busts, people’s moods change, and the second hand marches perpetually forward through time. Even on a personal level the feelings, pains, and joys we experience are constantly evolving and passing away. Reality is fluid. I’ve found if we focus on this fluidity and accept it as how our world works the less attached we become to our problems and the more we enjoy the good parts.

## Wait, what?
You wouldn’t be alone in thinking, “That’s all well and good, and an interesting philosophy, but what does that does that mean practically for me?”, I know I certainly did. The answer may be found if you practice observing the changes around you. For example, if you find yourself in a foul temper and feel in that moment that the world and everyone in it is against you, then just sit with that feeling and remind yourself that everything changes. Although it might appear silly at the time, more often than not if you continue to observe and be patient, the feeling will subside and a calmer mood will take you. The same applies to anything negative in life, a particularly frustrating person you work with (you will leave for home and they are no longer there), losing some money (you might easily earn it back again) or any such issue.

Most people are already aware of this impermanence. There is no new knowledge here. However many forget about it, stashing it in the recesses of our memories. The true benefit lies in reminding yourself from time to time. We become so caught up in the emotion that we perpetuate the negativity, in some cases for years. How many little annoyances do we have that build up over time? How else could we chose to look at this?

## On the positive
It’s not all about our problems. Personally, this simple thought process affects me the greatest in the more positive moments. In the best of times I remember to cherish the experience because I know it will not last forever. It brings us into the present, we’re able to relate deeper with other people because we’re less concerned about what will happen next or even worse… when the good times will pass on. Many people fall into the trap of never truly experiencing an enjoyable moment. Whenever something fortunate does happen into their lives, they become anxious of when it will leave and don’t actually live it. “Anicca” teaches us to be present. 

When something fantastic happens, or you are just in a good mood, then focus on all the little details that make it great. Remember it will pass at some point. Bring this to the foreground of your mind as often as possible. If you persist with this catching and observing of each moment, there is a point in which your life will shift towards the positive. You begin to notice the light of the situation, not the 1 million things that could or are going wrong. This in turn has a [powerful effect on those around you][1] and can change the course of your life and how you see it. 

## It’s all around us
Whatever way you choose now, the change is happening all around us. Close your eyes, and see if you can notice the passing of each breath, how it feels. Listen to the music and notice each passing beat. Watch the clouds blow overhead, and the how world around you shifts and adapts.  It falls on you and I to notice this and remember that *“this too shall pass”.*

## Get in touch
This is a vast topic! The principles here have so many wonderful applications and they’ve significantly impacted my life and those around me. I feel I’ve merely breached the surface and it’s my hope to write more practical ways to live by “anicca”. I genuinely welcome any suggestions and encourage an open discussion.
