# One of us
<time> Jan 15, 2017 </time>
 
An old friend and I were chattering away sitting on the decrepit, crumbling steps of a run down share-house and I was coming to a realisation. I could hear his words, see his movements, and to a point even understand what he was saying, but something was missing. It was as if there was an ever widening chasm between the two of us. How was it that where once we shared a strong connection, that we both felt was immutable, there now lay a divide that neither of us seemed able to cross? Out of a mutual respect for each other, which had grown over many years, we persisted in conversation. However, we could have been speaking in different languages. Eventually I stood up and left with a fond goodbye, not truly knowing if I would ever see him again.

This type of occurrence has frequented me increasingly over the past 6 months. People and experiences I held so dearly, surrounded myself with, and allowed to define me seemed to be drifting away due to some intangible force. I must admit the pace at which this was happening was quite alarming and I began to seriously question whether there was something wrong with the trajectory I had worked so hard to push myself toward. So many friends and even family members now looked at me with an odd perplexed expression, as if to say, “What *happened* to you?”. This very doubt is what holds so many of us back, keeping us in places and positions that don’t serve us. I was soon to learn that this distressing experience is normal and I was not alone.

## The middle path
Let me take you back several years before I was sitting on those steps. For the most part my life was everything you would expect in a relatively average, middle class, 18 year old, white male. I was working for less than I should have been, day dreaming of traveling the world, and generally a little lost for what to do. I had a good enough family, but we were not too close. My friends liked the same things I did, I had a few hobbies, and what few women I had in my life left me after a time for somebody more charismatic or interesting. I’m not writing any of this out of self pity, only to illustrate who I was then. I regularly encounter others in this position, and it’s a place that I feel many can relate to. 

There is a trap in mediocrity. You are neither too unhappy to move from the comfortable position, nor sufficiently driven to strive for a better life. In all respects, and if you are anything like I was, you resolve to living the middle life. Grow up, get an education, go to uni, get a job, a partner and a mortgage, have kids, get fat, divorce, and then die. It’s a routine all to familiar to us, yet nobody ever really speaks out against it. It’s passed down from generation to generation in a morbid cycle. Depression seeps in and along with it a sinking feeling that life will never, aside for fleeting moments, rise above the average. We are too afraid of being uncomfortable.

## “What happened to you?”
It was just as this reality was beginning to sink in that something changed. I met somebody who embodied all the things that I had wanted to be in life. The way they talked, thought, and behaved shouted violently at me, and with it an inspired awakening, a subtle lesson that would change the course of my entire life. 

This one encounter gave me hope. It grabbed my life by the shoulders and shook me as if to say, “Get a grip! If they can do it, so can you!”. You see, in mediocrity, people like the one I met are perceived to exist only in our movies and books. The middle path doesn’t recognise anything beyond what everyone else considers normal. It is fair to say the encounter broke my model of reality, and brought on a hunger to free myself of the predictable, and incessantly mundane, routine I called life. There was a spark ignited in that moment, the source of a blazing fire that to this day burns on.

> Matching **who** we are with **where** we are can be a powerful shift to improving our livelihood, beliefs, behaviours, and sense of contentment. 

From that moment forward, I vouched to surround myself with people who embodied what I wanted to be. I wanted to learn from those who would teach me from places of wisdom, those who had walked the path I was just beginning. I spent as much as time would allow with them, learning, understanding, and in turn cultivating an obsession for growth. Each snippet of advice was another log on the fire. A new language was introduced to me, and suddenly words and phrases like “perspective”, “model of the world”, “environment”, and “human needs” became an interwoven network to understand the complexities in life. It didn’t claim to solve all of life’s problems, rather create a way of discussing intangible feelings, the cycles of life people go through, and why we do the things we do. Most importantly, it taught me about environment. 

## Do I match?
Are the people around me bringing me down? Does my job that used to make me happy now feel limiting? Is my relationship causing me to feel upset or trapped more often than not? If you truthfully answered yes to any of these, then perhaps who you are is not matching your environment. Our environment (the people and places that surround our lives) plays a fundamental role in whether we feel in our element and aligned, or at unease and discordant in life. Matching **who** we are with **where** we are can be a powerful shift to improving our livelihood, beliefs, behaviours, and sense of contentment. 

Unfortunately, for those of us who come to this destination, it takes  considerable courage to disregard what **everyone ** is telling you, and to follow an internal compass that you feel to be right. It’s a hurdle that so many of us race up to, but when it comes to making the jump, we lose faith and hope returning back to where we started. I watched countless friends butt up against the Wall of Social Pressure, with such high hopes of breaking through, only to be discouraged by others returning from an unsuccessful attempt.

I determined that in fact who I was **did not** match my environment. My job was not allowing me to progress, my relationship was depressing me, and I felt frustrated with how negative everyone around me seemed. This was no fault of anyone, rather I had simply changed into someone else.

## Growing pains
Growth is by nature an uncomfortable experience. Anyone who has once tried to excel in something, pursue a goal or dream, or a new way of life knows the pain of creating this chasm. From the people around me now, I often hear that the hardest part in the process of bettering yourself is relating to those who care about you why you’ve changed. People like stability. We like life to be predictable and easy to follow so that we can understand a determined outcome. Growth upsets this norm. 

This comes at a great cost, for when you change, it creates a combination of disdain, jealousy, and even betrayal in those who are used to your old way of living. It is these individuals that you must rid yourself of. This task can be the hardest, especially if those individuals are family.

However, if you’re persistent, there will be those who love you unconditionally, accepting whatever decisions you make (be them good or bad), and believe in you. Over time, I feel it is these people that will filter down to be the closest, truest individuals to aid your journey. Cherish them, for they are rare and worth their weight in gold. Listen to them when they speak, make time for them, and help them when you can.

## Making the change
Where I am now, everything is new. I’ve moved to an incredible city, changed into the perfect job, entered a wonderful new relationship, and have a positive social circle. In the most part, all of these environments were consciously chosen with an end goal in mind. I now choose carefully who I spend time with and prioritise on those who will better my life in some way.

If you were to describe the life I live now to the 18 year old version all those years ago, I’m most sure he would not believe you. I persist in writing this as a humble attempt to inspire hope in those who read. I know all to well the vicissitudes of the middle path and am in many respects still in the transition out. My journey is by no means unique, nor particularly difficult.

If in some way this evokes any emotion in you, I implore you to ask yourself where you would like to be and who it is that could help you to get there. Plenty of times, the environment and people that would serve you most is already within your grasp, it only requires a little belief and a dash of courage. 

Are there people you know you shouldn’t spend time with? Good, remove them from your life. Delete their Facebook and their number, and replace them with someone more positive in your life. Is there someone who you really should catchup with, but have never really made the time? Good, call them as soon as you can, and arrange a time to meet. The ability to break away from the middle path is yours, but our eyes are so often covered to it’s power. Or you could choose to do nothing, to discount this message as something you’ll eventually get around to when the time suits you. That choice is yours to make, and my only hope is whatever you choose, it’s something that will aid you to become who you truly want to be.
