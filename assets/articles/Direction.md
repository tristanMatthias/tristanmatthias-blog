## Onboard message for proof-readers
Hey! I'm trying an experiment, and I need your help because I value your opinions! I've committed to writing a blog, in spirit of this years overall personal direction of improving my communication. I'm asking for your help because I trust you, know you're not afraid to call me on my shit, and have great insights into things I don't. You in? All I need is for you to look over what I write from time to time, and just say what you honestly think/feel. Also, happy new year 　:)!!
